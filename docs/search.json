    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to Machine Learning Systems with TinyML. This book is your gateway to the fast-paced world of AI systems through the lens of embedded systems. It is an extension of the course, TinyML from CS249r at Harvard University.\nOur aim is to make this open-source book a collaborative effort that brings together insights from students, professionals, and the broader community of applied machine learning practitioners. We want to create a one-stop guide that dives deep into the nuts and bolts of AI systems and their many uses.\n\n“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” – African Proverb\n\nThis isn’t just a static textbook; it’s a living, breathing document. We’re making it open-source and continually updated to meet the ever-changing needs of this dynamic field. Expect a rich blend of expert knowledge that guides you through the complex interplay between cutting-edge algorithms and the foundational principles that make them work. We’re setting the stage for the next big leap in tech innovation.\n\n\nWhy We Wrote This Book\nWe’re in an age where technology is always evolving. Open collaboration and sharing knowledge are the building blocks of true innovation. That’s the spirit behind Machine Learning Systems with TinyML. We’re going beyond the traditional textbook model to create a living knowledge hub.\nThe book covers principles, algorithms, and real-world application case studies, aiming to give you a deep understanding that will help you navigate the ever-changing landscape of embedded AI. By keeping it open, we’re not just making learning accessible; we’re inviting new ideas and ongoing improvements. In short, we’re building a community where knowledge is free to grow and light the way forward in global embedded AI tech.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Need to Know\nYou don’t need to be a machine learning whiz to dive into this book. All you really need is a basic understanding of systems and a curiosity to explore how embedded hardware, AI, and software come together. This is where innovation happens, and a basic grasp of how systems work will be your compass.\nWe’re also focusing on the exciting overlaps between these fields, aiming to create a learning environment where traditional boundaries fade away, making room for a more holistic, integrated view of modern tech. Your interest in embedded AI and low-level software will guide you through a rich and rewarding learning experience.\n\n\nBook Conventions\nFor details on the conventions used in this book, check out the Conventions section.\n\n\nWant to Help Out?\nIf you’re interested in contributing, you can find the guidelines here.\n\n\nGet in Touch\nGot questions or feedback?
